Teaching (and learning) is my great passion that began during my Teaching English as a Foreign Language studies back in 2016. I love exploring the subjects of neurodidactics and psychology of learning. I consider myself a life-long learner; I ceaselessly develop my French, Spanish and of course English (never stop learning!) <br><br> My specialty is teaching adults—I used to give classes at international companies. Currently I run my own business where I help people to gain confidence in speaking english in day-to-day situations.",

	"customer_review_1": "I spent countless hours in school, but I was never able to speak freely. It was only with Joanna that I opened up, and now I can talk to almost anyone!

What I like most is that she teaches me real, everyday English — not just textbook rules. We focus on useful phrases and vocabulary. She doesn't allow speaking Polish, which was stressful at first, but it really helped me start thinking in English and find ways to express what I want to say. I really enjoy our lessons and I'm glad I found her. She also adapts the topics to my interests. I genuinely recommend her to everyone!",

	"method_hero_title": "So, what does it mean that I teach natural language?",
	"method_hero_text": "My English philology studies gave me a solid foundation – they provided the base on which I built my language development. But it was only life in England and later abroad, with all the daily linguistic struggles and challenges, that truly showed me how to teach effectively. Over time, I also began to explore neurolinguistics to better understand how our brain works during language learning and how to make that process more efficient. That’s how I developed methods that really work and help students become independent language users.",

	"block1_subtitle": "No Program. More Freedom.",
	"block1_text": "We don't rely on any one particular textbook imposing contexts, pace and subjects. At SOUND English, I create materials tailored to your needs and context of your life. Together, we define what is the most beneficial to you, drawing inspiration from real-life situations you may encounter.

	"block2_title": "II.",
	"block2_subtitle": "Oral & Conversational.",
	"block2_text": "We start speaking from the very first lesson. My lessons are centred around conversation—what’s more important, controlled conversation supported by error analysis. Yes, analysis! Understanding where a mistake comes from helps your brain retain the information much better. Furthermore, we discuss topics related to your interests, work, and life—after all, these are the subjects you'll want to express your opinions about in discussions with English-speaking colleagues and friends.",
	"block3_title": "III.",
	"block3_subtitle": "Active-learning through role-plays.",
	"block3_text": "Role-plays are fun and useful. We prepare for real-life language challenges by acting out various scenarios during our lessons. You might face a job interview in a new country, viewing an apartment for rent, or asking for directions. We can rehearse these situations in our minds a hundred times, but until we confront them directly, we won’t fully know what vocabulary we are really missing. That’s why I exercise practical practice in my lessons—we act out different scenarios, which helps build fluency in real situations while also gathering the vocabulary and natural language responses typical of those circumstances.",
	"block4_title": "IV.",
	"block4_subtitle": "Work around it.",
	"block4_text": "Speaking fluently in a language you're learning is often mistakenly associated with knowing 100% of the vocabulary. Absolutely not! Fluency is not about mastering the entire Cambridge dictionary; it’s about the ability to smoothly navigate around or explain a phrase or word that might escape you at that moment. Even in our native language, words sometimes “slip away” and seem stuck at the “tip of your tongue.” In our first language, we don’t panic, feel embarrassed, or judged. That’s what we call linguistic fluency. We will also work on this in our lessons—not just knowing as many words as possible, but how to maneuver the vocabulary you already have.",
	"block5_title": "V.",
	"block5_subtitle": "Don’t learn it—understand it.",
	"block5_text": "Grammar, often a nightmare and a major discouraging factor for students, suddenly doesn't seem so intimidating. English grammar is quite logical and organized—it’s just unfortunate that school textbooks bombard us with long, complicated rules that seem to require memorization to speak correctly. Not at all. With me, we’ll focus exclusively on the essential grammatical elements that will quickly ensure your communicative proficiency and prevent misunderstandings. We’ll learn through UNDERSTANDING the mechanics of the language and finding connections, making it much easier for our brains—naturally designed for language learning—to remember and use new structures.",
	"block6_title": "VI.",
	"block6_subtitle": "Grow into an independent speaker.",
	"block6_text": "We won’t just learn the language; we will strive for complete linguistic independence. By the end of our course, you will not only know how to navigate daily situations with confidence but also how to continue your language development with pleasure using brain-friendly methods.",

	"about_hero_title": "A little about me...",
	"about_hero_text": "After graduating in English Studies in 2017, even though I already had two years of experience tutoring and teaching in a school, I decided to 'drop everything' and move to England. Why? A desire to see a piece of the world, improve my language skills, and open my mind. And that’s exactly what happened – after three years of living in London, I fell in love with the English language all over again. It became the language in which I expressed myself most naturally, and my conversational skills developed not only in the workplace but also – and perhaps most importantly – in social situations.<br><br>It was then, while sipping English beer in London pubs, that I began to notice the gap between language education and reality – the academic, textbook English we study at university doesn’t match everyday communication at all. Despite years of study, I didn’t feel as comfortable as one might expect.<br><br>Since then, my life mission has become teaching English in a practical, functional, and useful way – after all, language is just a tool. With my students, I focus on their lives, on situations they might encounter in real life, staying far away from textbook rules and long word lists just for the sake of finishing another chapter.<br><br>After returning to Poland, I started working at a language school specializing in Business English and General English courses for international companies. Thanks to this, I gained extensive knowledge and experience in teaching adults and continuously developed my skills in business language. Then, once again, I left Poland and moved to France – without knowing a single word of French.<br><br>Reality quickly showed me how difficult it is to live in a country whose language you don’t speak. Constantly relying on others, feeling lost, lacking control – even the simplest, everyday situations turned into major challenges. At that point, I became a student again and started learning French from scratch.<br><br>This experience helped me understand the difficulties my students face every day. Which situations can become obstacles, and how important it is to express oneself clearly. Through self-study, trial and error (and also with the help of some wise books about how our brain absorbs information), I developed effective self-learning techniques that I now share with my students. This process also gave me a deeper understanding of language learning from a student’s perspective.<br><br>Today, I continue my language development – even though English is the language I use daily at work, at home, and with friends, I’m also intensively developing my French and Spanish.",

	"about_contact_text": "The relationship between student and teacher is more than just a simple exchange of payment for a service. The collaboration often lasts for months, if not years, and the student’s progress largely depends on the quality of that relationship. That’s why I offer a free 30-minute trial lesson, which benefits both of us: I can assess your level, talk about your goals and the course format, and you can get a feel for my teaching style. Together, we can decide whether it feels right, whether there’s good communication between us and the right flow. If everything clicks – we can then set dates and work out the details of our collaboration.",
