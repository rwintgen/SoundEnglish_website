    "block2_title": "II.",
    "block2_subtitle": "Oral & Conversational.",
    "block2_text": "We start speaking from the very first lesson. My lessons are centred around conversation—what’s more important, controlled conversation supported by error analysis. Yes, analysis! Understanding where a mistake comes from helps your brain retain the information much better. Furthermore, we discuss topics related to your interests, work, and life—after all, these are the subjects you'll want to express your opinions about in discussions with English-speaking colleagues and friends.",
    "block3_title": "III.",
    "block3_subtitle": "Active-learning through role-plays.",
    "block3_text": "Role-plays are fun and useful. We prepare for real-life language challenges by acting out various scenarios during our lessons. You might face a job interview in a new country, viewing an apartment for rent, or asking for directions. We can rehearse these situations in our minds a hundred times, but until we confront them directly, we won’t fully know what vocabulary we are really missing. That’s why I exercise practical practice in my lessons—we act out different scenarios, which helps build fluency in real situations while also gathering the vocabulary and natural language responses typical of those circumstances.",
    "block4_title": "IV.",
    "block4_subtitle": "Work around it.",
    "block4_text": "Speaking fluently in a language you're learning is often mistakenly associated with knowing 100% of the vocabulary. Absolutely not! Fluency is not about mastering the entire Cambridge dictionary; it’s about the ability to smoothly navigate around or explain a phrase or word that might escape you at that moment. Even in our native language, words sometimes “slip away” and seem stuck at the “tip of your tongue.” In our first language, we don’t panic, feel embarrassed, or judged. That’s what we call linguistic fluency. We will also work on this in our lessons—not just knowing as many words as possible, but how to maneuver the vocabulary you already have.",
    "block5_title": "V.",
    "block5_subtitle": "Don’t learn it—understand it.",
    "block5_text": "Grammar, often a nightmare and a major discouraging factor for students, suddenly doesn't seem so intimidating. English grammar is quite logical and organized—it’s just unfortunate that school textbooks bombard us with long, complicated rules that seem to require memorization to speak correctly. Not at all. With me, we’ll focus exclusively on the essential grammatical elements that will quickly ensure your communicative proficiency and prevent misunderstandings. We’ll learn through UNDERSTANDING the mechanics of the language and finding connections, making it much easier for our brains—naturally designed for language learning—to remember and use new structures.",
    "block6_title": "VI.",
    "block6_subtitle": "Grow into an independent speaker.",
    "block6_text": "We won’t just learn the language; we will strive for complete linguistic independence. By the end of our course, you will not only know how to navigate daily situations with confidence but also how to continue your language development with pleasure using brain-friendly methods."
