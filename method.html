						How I teach adults English 3.4x faster with my method.
					</h2>
					<p>
						Since English has taken a predominant role nowadays, it is taught to kids since their youngest age.
						And then, nothing! What about adult learners? Should they stick to the methods with which kids are taught? <br><br>
						No. The adult brain and learning process are very different that those of a child, or even teenager.
						Discover how I adapted my teaching methodology to teach adults 3.4 times faster than conventional methods.

							No Program. More Freedom.
						</h2>
						<p>
							We don't rely on any one particular textbook imposing contexts, pace and subjects. At SOUND English,
							I create materials tailored to your needs and context of your  life. Together, we define what is the most beneficial
							to you, drawing inspiration from real-life situations you may encounter. Whole course is designed specifically
							for you to match linguistic challenges you face on a daily basis.<br>
							After each lesson, you will receive personalised homework on a shared google cloud to help reinforce the vocabulary
							and knowledge gained during our sessions, while also providing you with a daily dose of English essential for
							effectively developing your skills.

							Oral & Conversational.
						</h2>
						<p>
							We start speaking from the very first lesson. My lessons are centred around conversation—what’s more important,
							controled conversation supported by error analysis. Yes, analysis! Understanding where a mistake comes from
							helps your brain retain the information much better. Furthermore, we discuss topics related to your interests,
							work, and life—after all, these are the subjects you'll want to express your opinions about in discussions with
							English-speaking colleagues and friends.

						<h2>
							Active-learning through role-plays.
						</h2>
						<p>
							Role-plays are fun and useful. We prepare for real-life language challenges by acting out various scenarios
							during our lessons. You might face a job interview in a new country, viewing an apartment for rent,
							or asking for directions. We can rehearse these situations in our minds a hundred times, but until
							we confront them directly, we won’t fully know what vocabulary we are really missing.
							That’s why I exercise practical practice in my lessons—we act out different scenarios,
							which helps build fluency in real situations while also gathering the vocabularyand natural language
							responses typical of those circumstances.

						<h2>
							Work around it.
						</h2>
						<p>
							Speaking fluently in a language you're learning is often mistakenly associated with knowing 100% of
							the vocabulary. Absolutely not! Fluency is not about mastering the entire Cambridge dictionary;
							it’s about the ability to smoothly navigate around or explain a phrase or word that might escape you at that moment.
							Even in our native language, words sometimes “slip away” and seem stuck at the “tip of your tongue.”
							In our first language, we don’t panic, feel embarrassed, or judged. That’s what we call linguistic fluency.
							We will also work on this in our lessons—not just knowing as many words as possible,
							but how to maneuver the vocabulary you already have.

						<h2>
							Don’t learn it—understand it.
						</h2>
						<p>
							Grammar, often a nightmare and a major discouraging factor for students, suddenly doesn't seem so intimidating.
							English grammar is quite logical and organized—it’s just unfortunate that school textbooks bombard us with long,
							complicated rules that seem to require memorization to speak correctly. Not at all. With me, we’ll focus exclusively
							on the essential grammatical elements that will quickly ensure your communicative proficiency
							and prevent misunderstandings. We’ll learn through UNDERSTANDING the mechanics of the language and finding connections,
							making it much easier for our brains—naturally designed for language learning—to remember and use new structures.
