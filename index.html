				<h2>
					Who am I?
				</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Joanna Slupek and I am just like you — I’ve taken up the challenge of moving to foreign country(ies) ;) <br>
					But let’s start from the beginning. <br><br>
					I come from Rzeszow, Poland but I’ve been living half of my adult life abroad. Teaching (and learning)
					is my great passion that began during my Teaching English as a Foreign Language studies back in 2016.
					I love exploring the subjects of neurodidactics and psychology of learning. I consider myself a life-long learner;
					I ceaselessly develop my French, Spanish and of course English (never stop learning!) <br><br>
					My specialty is teaching adults — I used to give classes at international companies.
					Currently I run my own business where I help people to gain confidence in speaking english in day-to-day situations. <br>
